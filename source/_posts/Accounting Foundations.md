Financial income is an attempt to get as close to economic income as we can.

Accrual income(应计收入): 
- Follow the effort, not the cash
- Record revenue when work is performed

Taxable Income: 
- Follow the cash flow, not the effort
- Reported when cash is received

Income is taxed when income is earned, when the person has the ability to pay.
